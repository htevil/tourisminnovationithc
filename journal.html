            Tourism Innovations is a peer reviewed international journal committed to upholding the highest standards of
            publication ethics. In order to maintain a journal of the highest quality, the following principles of
            Publication Ethics and Malpractice Statement is adhered to. All articles not in accordance with these
            standards will be removed from the publication if malpractice is discovered at any time even after the
            publication. TI checks all papers in a double-blind peer review process. We also may check for plagiarism
            and falsification (manipulation of existing research data, tables, or images) and improper use of humans or
            animals in the research process when felt necessary. TI reserves the right to use plagiarism detecting
            software to screen submitted papers at any times.<br><br>
            Authors must ensure that they have written original works. In addition they must ensure that the manuscript
            has not been issued elsewhere. Any work or words of other authors, contributors, or sources should be
            appropriately credited and referenced. Authors are also responsible for language editing before submitting
            the article. Authors submitting their works to the journal for publication as original articles confirm that
            the submitted works represent their authors’ contributions and have not been copied or plagiarized in whole
            or in part from other works without clearly citing. Any work or words of other authors, contributors, or
            sources (including online sites) should be appropriately credited and referenced. All authors should
            disclose financial or other conflict of interest that might influence the results or interpretation of their
            manuscript (financial support for the project should be disclosed). When an author discovers a significant
            error or inaccuracy in his/her own published work, it is the author’s obligation to promptly notify the
            journal editor and cooperate with the editor to retract or correct the paper. An author agrees to the
            license agreement before submitting the article.<br><br>
            Editors must ensure a fair double-blind peer-review of the submitted articles for publication. They will
            strive to prevent any conflict of interests between the author and editorial and review personnel. Editors
            will also ensure that all the information related to submitted manuscripts is kept as confidential before
            publishing. Editor-in-Chief will coordinate the work of the editors.<br><br>
            Reviewers evaluate manuscripts based on content without regard to ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation,
            citizenship, religious belief or political philosophy of the authors. They must ensure that all the
            information related to submitted manuscripts is kept as confidential and must report to the Editor-in-Chief
            if they are aware of copyright infringement and plagiarism on the author’s side. They must evaluate the
            submitted works objectively as well as present clearly their opinions on the works in a clear way in the
            review form. Reviewers who feel unqualified to review a submitted article or know that its prompt review
            will be impossible should notify the Editor-in-Chief and excuse themselves from the review process.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="subsection-title">Review Policy:</h2>
        <p class="section-paragraph">
            All submitted manuscripts are read by the editorial staff. To save time for authors and peer-reviewers, only
            those papers that seem most likely to meet our editorial criteria are sent for formal review. Those papers
            judged by the editors to be of insufficient general interest or otherwise inappropriate are rejected
            promptly without external review (although these decisions may be based on informal advice from specialists
            in the field).<br><br>
            Manuscripts judged to be of potential interest to our readership are sent for formal review, typically to
            two reviewers, but sometimes more if special advice is needed (for example on statistics or a particular
            technique). The editors then make a decision based on the reviewers’ advice, from among several
            possibilities:
        </p>
        <ul class="ithc-list">
            <li>Accept, with or without editorial revisions.</li>
            <li>Invite the authors to revise their manuscript to address specific concerns before a final decision is
                reached.</li>
            <li>Reject, but indicate to the authors that further work might justify a resubmission.</li>
            <li>Reject outright, typically on grounds of specialist interest, lack of novelty, insufficient conceptual
                advance or major technical and/or interpretational problems</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2 class="subsection-title">Selecting peer-reviewers:</h2>
        <p class="section-paragraph">
            Reviewer selection is critical to the publication process, and we base our choice on many factors, including
            expertise, reputation, specific recommendations and our own previous experience of a reviewer’s
            characteristics. For instance, we avoid using people who are slow, careless, or do not provide reasoning for
            their views, whether harsh or lenient. We check with potential reviewers before sending them manuscripts to
            review. Reviewers should bear in mind that these messages contain confidential information, which should be
            treated as such. The reviewers are experts mainly from the list of ITHC members.
