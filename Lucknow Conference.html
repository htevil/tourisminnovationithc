        <h2 class="subsection-title">Introduction to Seminar</h2>
        <p class="section-paragraph">
            Tourism is primarily a human activity, which involves travel from an originating area to a destination for
            pleasure or business purposes. This seemingly simple phenomenon embraces cultural, economic and social
            exchanges in the process. Travel and tourism is one of the biggest industries in the world in terms of gross
            output and value added, capital investment, employment generation, tax contributions, heritage awareness and
            cultural sensitization. This phenomenon also addresses critical issues like environmental protection, global
            warming integral to sustaining life on earth.<br>
            Tourism activities, which a decade ago focused on Europe and North America, have seen a marked shift towards
            East Asia and recently towards South Asia. India emerges as the major player in this region. The
            implications are enormous, opportunities unlimited, challenges immense and responsibilities above all are
            huge. India is also witnessing a phenomenal explosion of domestic tourism and the outbound tourism which is
            an inevitable by-product of the prosperity that India has achieved during the last decade.<br>
            The economic liberalisation and reform process of the 1990s, enabled tourism sector to attract investment
            for tourism related infrastructure development. The National policy on tourism was announced in the year
            2002, with the following as its salient features: positioning tourism as a major engine of economic growth;
            harnessing the direct and multiplier effects of tourism for employment generation, economic development and
            providing impetus to rural tourism; focus on domestic tourism as a major driver of tourism growth;
            position<br><br>
            India as a global brand to take advantage of the burgeoning global travel and trade and the vast untapped
            potential of India as a destination; acknowledge the critical role of private sector with government working
            as a pro-active facilitator and catalyst; create and develop integrated tourism circuits based on India’s
            unique civilization, heritage and culture in partnership with States, private sector and other agencies.<br>
            In conjunction with the new tourism policy of 2002, Government of India also adopted a multipronged approach
            for promotion of tourism, which included new mechanism for expediting implementation of tourism projects,
            development of integrated tourism circuits and rural destinations, special capacity building in the
            unorganized hospitality sector and new marketing strategies to promote India as a brand. This would ensure
            that the tourist to India gets physically invigorated, mentally rejuvenated, culturally enriched,
            spiritually elevated and “Feel India from Within”.<br>
            India’s tourism industry, be it inbound, outbound or domestic – every segment has witnessed rapid changes
            especially in the last five years. India is the fastest growing tourist economy where tourism has grown at a
            very healthy 13% per annum in the past four years. The average annual growth rate has been more than 10%
            since 2000. Many of the States in India are formulating policies and programme to cater to the growing
            demand of inbound tourism.<br>
            However there are still infrastructural inadequacies that are constraining the growth of tourism in India.
            There is a marked gap in room supply, air capacity, connectivity and inadequate airports, roads and other
            infrastructure compared to global standards. Also tourism development needs to be pursued with a focus on
            sustainability. This involves, checking the indiscriminate growth of tourism, and controlling the associated
            problems of pollution, traffic congestions, environmental and ecological hazard and cultural degradation.
            The success of any policy to a large extent depends on identifying and addressing challenges strategically
            for its effective implementation. This requires carefully worked out intervention programmes. The focus of
            the conference is to draw a blue print and deduct directives for effective tourism development in India.<br>
